# 1. Overview

## 1.1 Purpose

The **Discovery Engine (DE)** is an AI-native infrastructure for the synthesis, navigation, and generation of scientific knowledge. It re-engineers how knowledge is extracted from literature, structured for reasoning, and explored for insight. The goal is to **transform the static, document-centric scientific landscape into a dynamic, computable knowledge environment**.

This system design introduces a machine-operable core — the **Conceptual Nexus Model (CNM)** — that encodes scientific understanding in a format optimised for both human and AI interaction. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), graph theory, vector symbolic architectures, and tensor algebra, the DE enables:

- Semantic synthesis across disciplines
- High-resolution knowledge gap detection
- Composable hypothesis generation
- Scalable field mapping and forecasting

## 1.2 Problem Space

Modern science faces a paradox of progress:

| Challenge                     | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Information Overload         | Millions of new papers per year render manual synthesis infeasible          |
| Reproducibility Crisis       | Experimental ambiguity and methodological opacity threaten trust            |
| Semantic Fragmentation       | Scientific ideas are scattered and expressed heterogeneously                |
| Inefficient Discovery Loops  | Serendipitous insight is bottlenecked by poor conceptual connectivity        |
| Legacy Document Format       | PDF-based papers limit machine reasoning and automation                     |

Traditional systems of academic dissemination — journal articles, archives, citation chains — are poorly aligned with the needs of modern AI tools, and lack structure, composability, and semantic traceability.

## 1.3 Solution Overview

The Discovery Engine proposes a **systemic reframing of science as a navigable knowledge space**, where core units of meaning (concepts, methods, claims) are **extracted, represented, and composed** as formalised entities.

### Key Mechanism

```
Scientific Corpus (e.g. PDFs) 
      ↓
Distillation Templates + LLMs 
      ↓
Structured Knowledge Artifacts (Concepts, Methods, Results)
      ↓
Encoding into a Conceptual Nexus Tensor (TCNM)
      ↓
Projection into:
    - CNM Graph View (for human interaction)
    - Semantic Vector Spaces (for clustering & analogy)
      ↓
AI Agents for:
    - Exploration
    - Gap detection
    - Hypothesis generation
```

### Core Benefits

| Capability                          | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Computable Knowledge**           | Machine-readable knowledge primitives for automation                        |
| **Semantic Compression**           | Tensor encoding reduces redundancy, amplifies signal                        |
| **Dynamic Exploration**            | Agents and users can traverse, query, and visualise concepts natively       |
| **Principled Synthesis**           | Aligns disparate ideas using formal schema and vector logic                 |
| **Hypothesis Co-Creation**         | Suggests experiment design and theory construction grounded in structure    |

## 1.4 Role in Scientific Process

The DE intervenes at several points in the scientific pipeline:

| Stage                  | Traditional Mode                      | DE Mode                                                      |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Knowledge Capture      | PDF reading + note-taking             | Structured LLM distillation via adaptive templates            |
| Knowledge Integration  | Manual synthesis + memory             | Tensor encoding and graph integration                        |
| Exploration            | Keyword search + reference chasing    | Concept graph traversal + vector similarity + thematic maps  |
| Hypothesis Generation  | Serendipitous or domain-specific      | Data-driven synthesis from gaps and analogies                |
| Validation             | Peer consensus                        | Provenance tracking, consistency metrics, citation networks  |

## 1.5 High-Level System Goals

1. **Codify scientific understanding** as dynamic, modular, reusable components.
2. **Enable AI agents** to operate directly on structured knowledge graphs.
3. **Augment human insight** via co-navigation, gap detection, and design support.
4. **Accelerate discovery** by unifying reasoning, synthesis, and hypothesis generation.
5. **Future-proof scientific infrastructure** via FAIR-aligned, machine-native representation.
