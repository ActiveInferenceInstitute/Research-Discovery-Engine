## 1. Overview

The **Discovery Engine (DE)** is a computational framework for transforming the fragmented corpus of scientific publications into a **structured, machine-operable knowledge system**. It achieves this by using LLM-guided distillation to extract verifiable knowledge artifacts from literature and encode them into a **Conceptual Nexus Model (CNM)** — a computable, high-dimensional tensor representation of a scientific domain.

This document outlines the architecture, core components, and design rationale behind the Discovery Engine.

## 2. Motivation

Scientific literature has scaled beyond the point of manual assimilation. Current challenges include:

- Information overload and siloed findings
- Poor reproducibility and growing retraction rates
- A document-centric format ill-suited to machine learning or reasoning

The DE reimagines literature not as a static archive but as a **dynamic, explorable knowledge graph**, structured for both human and AI interaction.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 System Components

| Component               | Function                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Distillation Engine** | LLMs extract structured knowledge artifacts using adaptive templates     |
| **Template Schema**     | Field-specific, self-refining schema based on formal conceptual mappings |
| **Conceptual Tensor**   | High-dimensional tensor encoding relationships among concepts            |
| **CNM Graph View**      | Human-readable knowledge graph projection from the tensor                |
| **AI Agent Layer**      | Performs reasoning, navigation, and hypothesis generation                |
| **Synthesis Engine**    | Integrates, aligns, and resolves entity relationships across literature  |

### 3.2 Data Flow

1. Input: Raw scientific documents (e.g. PDFs, preprints)
2. Distillation via adaptive template
3. Extraction of knowledge artifacts (structured JSON-like objects)
4. Encoding into Conceptual Tensor (TCNM)
5. Projection into graph and vector space views
6. AI agent interaction and downstream analytics

## 4. Key Concepts

### 4.1 Knowledge Artifact

A structured unit of distilled information extracted from literature. Includes:

- Concepts and hypotheses
- Methodological details and parameters
- Results and findings
- Linked source provenance

### 4.2 Conceptual Nexus Model (CNM)

A hybrid representation comprising:

- **Knowledge Graph**: Nodes (entities, methods, systems) and edges (causal, evidence-based links)
- **Vector Embeddings**: Semantic similarity layers using VSA/HDC techniques
- **Tensor Encoding (TCNM)**: Core computational substrate

## 5. Template System

### 5.1 Structure

Templates are defined in Markdown and modularised:

- M0: Metadata
- M1: Core Claims
- M2: Systems & Entities
- M3: Parameters
- M4: Mechanisms
- M5: Observations
- M6: Limitations

### 5.2 Self-Refining Feedback Loop

Templates evolve through corpus-aligned feedback:

- LLMs flag missing or mismatched schema fields
- Meta-analysis identifies recurring gaps
- Schema is updated to increase coverage and fidelity

Inspired by: iterative refinement (ML), self-consistent field theory (physics), and co-design with domain experts.

## 6. FAIR Principles

The CNM is designed around **FAIR compliance**:

| Principle       | Implementation                                                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Findable        | Rich metadata and searchable graph interface                           |
| Accessible      | Structured JSON, API, and UI-based access                              |
| Interoperable   | Standardised ontologies and concept schemas                            |
| Reusable        | Provenance-linked, granular, composable components                     |

## 7. AI Integration

AI agents operate directly on the CNM structure using:

- Graph traversal
- Vector search and analogy mapping
- Tensor completion (e.g. knowledge inference)
- Hypothesis generation and simulation design

Agents are capable of:

- Detecting gaps, contradictions, and analogies
- Generating structured hypotheses with CNM alignment
- Producing new Knowledge Artifacts

## 8. Knowledge Synthesis Pipeline

1. **Entity Alignment**: Semantic, structural, and identifier resolution
2. **Integration**: Aggregation, conflict marking, statistical synthesis
3. **Dynamic Views**:
   - Thematic clustering (e.g. BERTopic)
   - Graph centrality analysis
   - Parameter correlation landscapes

## 9. Use Cases

### 9.1 Case Study: Intelligent Soft Matter

- Domain: Responsive materials with embedded intelligence
- Outcome: Synthesised CNM of current field, knowledge gaps, and future roadmap
- Collaborative perspective generated using DE + domain experts

### 9.2 Case Study: DE Platform Design

- Meta-application: DE used to design itself
- Input corpus: HCI, explainable AI, knowledge graph interaction
- Result: DE frontend architecture, user modules, UI schema (React + TypeScript)

## 10. Limitations

| Limitation                 | Mitigation Strategy                                           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|

| Computational scalability  | Modular processing, vector compression, distributed pipelines |

## 11. Vision

The Discovery Engine aims to:

- Serve as an AI-readable **World Model** of science
- Shift from document-centric to **knowledge-centric** scientific infrastructure
- Support rational discovery loops: *Observe → Integrate → Hypothesise → Test*
- Enhance research navigation, creativity, and reproducibility

The ultimate goal is not just a better search engine — but a **genuine engine of discovery**.
