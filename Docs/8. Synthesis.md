# 8. Knowledge Synthesis Pipeline

The **Knowledge Synthesis Pipeline** is the operational backbone of the Discovery Engine. It is the process through which isolated, raw, and unstructured knowledge fragments are transformed into an integrated, computable model of a scientific field.

This pipeline enables the **emergence of structure** from large corpora — surfacing patterns, resolving inconsistencies, and enabling hypothesis generation.

---

## 8.1 Purpose of the Pipeline

To go beyond extraction and achieve:

- **Semantic Integration**: Connect fragments into coherent conceptual structures
- **Cross-document Alignment**: Reconcile terminology, metrics, and methodologies
- **Analytical Synthesis**: Detect gaps, clusters, conflicts, and emergent patterns
- **Hypothesis Readiness**: Prepare knowledge for design, simulation, or reasoning tasks

## 8.3 Stage 1: Entity Alignment

Goal: Resolve semantically equivalent entities across documents.

### Techniques

| Approach                       | Example                                                            |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **String similarity**          | “stimulus-responsive polymer” ≈ “responsive polymer”               |
| **Ontology mapping**           | Links entity to ChEBI, MeSH, etc.                                  |
| **Embedding comparison**       | Vector closeness of concept nodes in semantic space                |
| **Source triangulation**       | Cross-references among citations + provenance                      |

### Output

- Canonicalised `ConceptNode`, `MethodNode`, `ParameterNode` clusters
- Resolved identity across papers
- Linkage confidence score

---

## 8.4 Stage 2: Relational Integration

Goal: Merge and reconcile relations between entities.

| Operation Type          | Function                                                             |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Merge equivalent edges** | Unify multiple `EVIDENCE_FOR` links across papers                  |
| **Conflict annotation**     | Tag contradictory `CAUSES` relations                               |
| **Chain composition**       | Build multi-step causal paths from atomic relations                |
| **Graph pruning**           | Remove low-confidence or unsupported connections                   |

### Output

- Integrated multi-source knowledge graph
- Composite artifacts (e.g. models or hypotheses from merged claims)
- Conflict or contradiction subgraphs

---

## 8.5 Stage 3: Gap Detection

Goal: Surface **missing links**, **disconnected nodes**, and **data voids**.

### Heuristics

| Heuristic                  | Example                                                           |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Disconnected triads**    | X causes Y, Z similar to X → expect Z causes Y?                  |
| **Dangling parameter**     | Method used but parameter range never specified                   |
| **Empty slot**             | Template field often unfilled (e.g., “limitation”)                |
| **Missing intermediate**   | X → ? → Z (chain incomplete)                                     |

### Output

- `GapNode` insertion
- Suggestions for experiment or exploration
- Ranked list of missing or weakly defined regions

---

## 8.6 Stage 4: Topological & Thematic Mapping

Goal: Enable high-level navigation and insight across large fields.

### Output Layers

| Mapping Type                | Description                                                      |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Topic Models (BERTopic)** | Thematic clusters of CNM nodes and documents                     |
| **Graph Motif Detection**   | Frequent structural patterns (e.g., feedback loops, triads)      |
| **Temporal Maps**           | Field evolution by publication date or concept emergence         |
| **Parameter Landscapes**    | Multivariate views of experimental configurations                |

These are rendered as **visual layers** over the CNM graph or as dimensionality-reduced maps.

---

## 8.7 Stage 5: View Generation & Export

Final outputs of the pipeline support diverse use cases:

| Output View                 | Description                                                     |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CNM Graph View**          | Interactive navigation of concept/method/claim network          |
| **Embedding Browser**       | Semantic similarity explorer (e.g., find analogues to concept X)|
| **Gap Explorer**            | Table + graph of missing connections                           |
| **Hypothesis Surface**      | Structured space of generated or candidate hypotheses           |
| **Field Map Dashboard**     | Thematic overview of a scientific domain                        |

All views are connected to provenance data and exportable as JSON, CSV, RDF, or visual formats.

## 8.8 Agent Roles in the Pipeline

| Agent          | Stage                  | Function                                                       |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Aligner**     | Stage 1                | Resolve identity across similar concepts                       |
| **Integrator**  | Stage 2                | Merge, prune, and reconcile conflicting relations              |
| **GapFinder**   | Stage 3                | Detect missing or incomplete conceptual structures             |
| **Topologist**  | Stage 4                | Analyse graph motifs and thematic clusters                     |
| **ViewMaker**   | Stage 5                | Generate interactive outputs and visual summaries              |

Agents may work in isolation or as **multi-agent workflows** over slices of the CNM.

## 8.9 Human-in-the-Loop Synthesis

While agents automate much of the process, **human feedback is integral** to:

- Schema refinement (e.g. “missing node type”)
- Gap validation (“is this really unknown?”)
- Conflict resolution (interpretation-based disagreement)
- Hypothesis filtering and ranking

The synthesis pipeline includes UI affordances for **domain expert tagging**, commenting, and comparison.

---

## 8.10 Summary

The Knowledge Synthesis Pipeline turns thousands of disconnected papers into:

✅ An integrated, explainable knowledge graph  
✅ A semantic topology of a scientific field  
✅ A map of gaps, contradictions, and open questions  
✅ A launchpad for structured hypothesis generation
