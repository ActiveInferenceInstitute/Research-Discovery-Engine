# 6. FAIR Principles and Interoperability

The Discovery Engine is designed from the ground up to comply with the **FAIR data principles** — a framework ensuring that scientific information is *Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable*. These principles are not retrofitted, but embedded directly into the architecture, data structures, and operational logic of the system.

---

## 6.1 Why FAIR?

Scientific knowledge has traditionally been:

- Locked inside PDFs and prose
- Poorly annotated or structured
- Inaccessible to non-specialist agents (both human and AI)

FAIR compliance is essential to transition from static archives to a **machine-operable scientific substrate**.

## 6.2 Principle Breakdown

### F — Findable

**Goal**: Ensure that knowledge artifacts and their relationships can be easily discovered by both humans and machines.

| Mechanism                          | Description                                                           |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unique identifiers                 | Every concept, artifact, and relation receives a stable ID (e.g., `cnm:Artifact/001238`) |
| Rich metadata                      | All nodes contain typed metadata (e.g., domain, source, timestamp)   |
| Indexable structure                | Artifacts are embedded in vector space and indexed for fast retrieval |
| Searchable graph topology          | Enables graph-based queries: “Find all causal links to concept X”     |

**Example**: A researcher can locate all parameters linked to a specific experimental method within 2 hops on the CNM graph.

---

### A — Accessible

**Goal**: Ensure knowledge is retrievable using standardised protocols with clear provenance and usage rights.

| Mechanism                          | Description                                                        |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| API access                         | REST/GraphQL interfaces expose structured graph and tensor data    |
| UI-based browsing                  | Frontend allows concept-based navigation and query composition     |
| Source-linked artifacts            | All extracted claims reference original text fragments             |
| Access-level tagging               | Artifacts can carry visibility and licensing constraints           |

**Example**: AI agents can access a publication’s structured claims via API, and trace each to its source paragraph.

---

### I — Interoperable

**Goal**: Ensure that data can be integrated with other systems, tools, and ontologies.

| Mechanism                             | Description                                                        |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Universal Concept Schema (UCS)        | Shared across all fields; field-specific extensions allowed         |
| Ontology mapping                      | CNM nodes can be aligned with existing biomedical or physical ontologies (e.g., MeSH, ChEBI) |
| JSON-LD/OWL support                   | CNM exportable in web-native linked data formats                   |
| Common vocabularies                   | Terminology anchored in shared glossaries                          |

**Example**: An artifact from a biology paper can be linked to a chemical entity in ChEBI using ontology tags on the node.

---

### R — Reusable

**Goal**: Enable long-term reuse of artifacts by embedding semantic, contextual, and epistemic metadata.

| Mechanism                            | Description                                                         |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Provenance trace                     | Every artifact linked to exact source text and extraction date      |
| Version control                      | Knowledge graphs are snapshot-versioned for reproducibility         |
| Scientific utility scoring           | Artifacts rated for clarity, confidence, generality, and relevance  |
| Composability                        | Artifacts can be reused in multiple graph contexts or hypothesis structures |

**Example**: A parameter value extracted from one paper can be reused in simulations or compared across systems using its metadata and context.

## 6.3 FAIR in the Discovery Engine Workflow

```plaintext
[LLM Extraction]
    ↓
[Schema-Aligned Artifact]
    ↓
[Metadata Enrichment]
    ↓
[Graph Insertion + Tensor Encoding]
    ↓
[APIs and UI for Discovery + Composition]
    ↓
[Versioned Storage and Access Control]
```

Each step of the pipeline adds FAIR-compliant structure and traceability, ensuring that the output is *not just data* — but scientifically reusable **knowledge infrastructure**.

## 6.4 Interoperability Strategy

To support integration across diverse knowledge systems:

| Strategy Element             | Description                                                   |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ontology Bridges**         | Modular mapping layer to biomedical, engineering, or materials science ontologies |
| **Field-Specific Modules**   | Templates and schemas tailored to domain standards            |
| **Standardised Exports**     | JSON-LD, RDF/XML, and OWL serialisation of CNM subgraphs      |
| **Cross-field alignment**    | Parameter clustering, vector comparison, and concept matching across domains |

This allows Discovery Engine to *plug in* to digital lab notebooks, automated reasoning engines, simulation platforms, or collaborative research tools.
