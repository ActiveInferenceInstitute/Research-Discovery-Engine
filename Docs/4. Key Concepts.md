# 4. Key Concepts

The Discovery Engine is built on a small but powerful set of semantic primitives. These define how knowledge is represented, organised, and interacted with — both by humans and AI agents. Together, they enable the transformation of unstructured scientific discourse into a **structured, navigable knowledge space**.

---

## 4.1 Knowledge Artifact

A **Knowledge Artifact** is the atomic unit of scientific meaning in the DE system. It encapsulates a verifiable claim, method, observation, or parameter configuration distilled from a single document.

### Structure

| Field                  | Description                                                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `type`                | Conceptual role (e.g., "Method", "Hypothesis", "Parameter")     |
| `value`               | Canonicalised text or numerical value                           |
| `contextual binding`  | Linked node or subgraph within the CNM                          |
| `provenance`          | Direct source reference to publication or excerpt               |
| `verifiability_score` | Computed confidence from template extraction & cross-reference  |
| `relations`           | List of structured relations to other artifacts                 |

Each artifact is schema-aligned, provenance-anchored, and semantically tagged.

## 4.2 Conceptual Nexus Model (CNM)

The **CNM** is a hybrid representation of scientific knowledge combining:

- **Heterogeneous knowledge graph**
- **High-dimensional tensor (TCNM)**
- **Semantic vector spaces**

It is not merely a container of facts, but a structured semantic landscape representing **how facts, methods, assumptions, and findings interrelate**.

### Representations

| View                  | Function                                                              |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CNM Graph View**     | Explicit symbolic graph: concepts, methods, systems, papers, etc.     |
| **Tensor (TCNM)**      | Multimodal latent structure: enables algebraic reasoning              |
| **Vector Embedding Space** | Soft semantic topology for clustering, analogy, and traversal   |

---

## 4.3 Universal Concept Schema (UCS)

The **Universal Concept Schema** defines the node and edge types used throughout the CNM. It is **domain-agnostic but extensible**, and ensures that knowledge is represented consistently across disciplines.

### Core Node Types

| Type                | Role                                                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ConceptNode`       | Theoretical or empirical ideas (e.g., "Neuroplasticity")             |
| `MethodNode`        | Experimental or analytical techniques (e.g., "Western Blot")         |
| `SystemNode`        | Physical or simulated systems under study                            |
| `ParameterNode`     | Quantitative or categorical variables (e.g., "temperature = 37°C")   |
| `MechanismNode`     | Functional processes (e.g., "feedback inhibition")                   |
| `ObservationNode`   | Empirical findings (e.g., "increase in membrane voltage")            |
| `PublicationNode`   | Source papers                                                         |
| `KnowledgeArtifactNode` | Composed hypotheses, designs, or models                          |
| `KnowledgeGapNode`  | Explicitly identified absences or inconsistencies in the CNM         |

### Core Edge Types

| Edge Type            | Interpretation                                                       |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CAUSES`              | A → B implies causal influence                                       |
| `USES_INPUT`          | Method uses a Parameter or Concept                                   |
| `EVIDENCE_FOR`        | Observation supports Hypothesis or Mechanism                         |
| `IS_A`                | Taxonomic hierarchy                                                  |
| `SIMILAR_TO`          | Soft semantic similarity                                             |
| `CONFLICTS_WITH`      | Opposed claims or interpretations                                    |
| `FILLS_GAP_IN`        | Connects a new artifact to a previous gap                            |

These edges are typed, directional, and support reasoning over the graph structure.

## 4.4 Distillation Template

A **Distillation Template** is a field-specific schema that guides the LLM to extract structured information from a publication. Templates define:

- Expected knowledge types (e.g., hypothesis, system, result)
- Slot definitions (e.g., units, confidence, justification)
- Internal structure and relation mappings
- Evidence requirements and scoring rubrics

### Template Modules (Example)

| Module ID | Purpose                                        |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| M0        | Metadata (title, authors, DOI)                 |
| M1        | Core Claims and Hypotheses                     |
| M2        | Entities and Systems                           |
| M3        | Methods and Protocols                          |
| M4        | Parameters and Conditions                      |
| M5        | Results and Observations                       |
| M6        | Limitations, Constraints, Open Questions       |

Templates can evolve through **self-consistent refinement** (see Sec. 5).

## 4.5 Verifiability and Robustness Scores

Each extracted artifact is evaluated using **FAIR-aligned scoring dimensions**, ensuring scientific utility beyond citation count.

| Score Dimension        | Description                                                        |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Findability**         | Is the artifact clearly defined and searchable?                    |
| **Accessibility**       | Is the data/method well documented and replicable?                 |
| **Interoperability**    | Can it connect to related artifacts via standard mappings?         |
| **Reusability**         | Is it generalisable and grounded in verifiable evidence?           |
| **Predictive Consistency** | Does it align with broader patterns in the CNM?               |

These scores inform artifact weighting in synthesis and hypothesis generation.

## 4.6 Conceptual Integrity

The CNM is designed to support formal and informal reasoning.

### Formal Integrity

- Schema-conformant nodes and relations
- Explicit provenance paths
- Support for composition via Category Theory-inspired mappings

### Emergent Semantics

- Meaning arises from:
  - Local context (document and surrounding artifacts)
  - Global structure (CNM graph and tensor position)
