# 9. Use Cases

The Discovery Engine is a general-purpose framework for scientific synthesis, capable of supporting a wide range of applications. This section presents concrete use cases that demonstrate its utility across disciplines, workflows, and conceptual tasks — from field exploration to hypothesis generation.

## 9.1 Use Case 1: Field Synthesis in Intelligent Soft Matter

### Context

A research team is investigating **adaptive materials** — substances that respond dynamically to stimuli (e.g. light, heat, electrical input). Literature is scattered across biology, materials science, physics, and robotics.

### Challenges

- Terminological inconsistency (e.g. "stimulus-responsive" vs. "programmable")
- Poor cross-domain synthesis
- Redundant experiments with slight variations

### Discovery Engine Process

| Step                        | Result                                                       |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Template-driven extraction  | Structured concepts from 200+ papers                        |
| Concept alignment           | Normalised key entities (e.g., feedback mechanisms)         |
| CNM generation              | Interactive graph of materials, stimuli, behaviours         |
| Gap detection               | Highlighted missing long-term performance metrics            |
| AI-supported hypothesis     | Proposed new hydrogel-circuit hybrid with time-based feedback|

### Output

- Navigable knowledge graph of adaptive materials
- Structured performance comparisons
- Suggested next experiments + simulations
- Identified publication clusters by function/mechanism

## 9.2 Use Case 2: Discovery Engine Designs Itself

### Context

The development team is using the Discovery Engine to design its own knowledge interface — particularly the frontend system for CNM browsing and composition.

### Input Corpus

- HCI papers on graph exploration
- Explainable AI research
- Knowledge graph UI frameworks
- Cognitive load and concept design literature

### DE Workflow

- Templates extract interface patterns (e.g., filter paradigms, zooming techniques)
- Agent clusters UX mechanisms by functionality (e.g., sensemaking, summarisation)
- Topological synthesis links cognitive strategies with UI affordances
- Output artefact: Schema for a modular interface layer supporting multi-perspective exploration

### Result

- DE’s UI was co-designed using DE itself
- Reusable interface component taxonomy emerged
- Field-tested with domain experts

## 9.3 Use Case 3: Rapid Literature Review for Grant Proposal

### Scenario

A researcher needs to write a grant proposal on **biocompatible piezoelectric materials** for neural stimulation.

### Tasks Supported by DE

- **Semantic search**: Find functionally related materials even if described differently
- **Graph traversal**: Surface design patterns (e.g., material + stimulation + safety combo)
- **Parameter extraction**: Retrieve value ranges for relevant configurations
- **Gap nodes**: Identify areas not yet explored (e.g. chronic response > 6 months)
- **Auto-generated synopsis**: Draft domain overview and design rationale

### Outcome

- Grant proposal includes 3 potential materials, known gaps, and a novel hypothesis
- Time reduced from 3 weeks to 3 days

## 9.4 Use Case 4: Cross-Disciplinary Analogy Discovery

### Scenario

A physics lab is studying **feedback control in soft actuators**, and wants inspiration from biological systems.

### DE Functionality

- Agents map **functional motifs** (e.g., negative feedback loops) in both corpora
- Vector embeddings surface soft analogies between biofeedback and actuation design
- Hypotheses generated around membrane voltage control mimicking mechanotransduction

### Output

- Conceptual bridges across biology and robotics
- Merged CNM subgraph linking disparate domains
- Joint publication roadmap proposed with biology lab

## 9.5 Use Case 5: Journal-Level Audit and Field Map

### Scenario

An editor wants to understand the **epistemic health** of their journal's corpus over the past 5 years.

### DE Workflow

- All articles processed into artifacts + CNM structure
- Conflict subgraphs surfaced (e.g., contradictory claims, disputed mechanisms)
- Gap frequency measured (unanswered questions, missing data types)
- Thematic clusters generated over time

### Visual Dashboard Includes

| Metric                     | Insight Generated                                              |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Claim density per article  | Signal vs. noise                                              |
| Edge redundancy            | Repetition of ideas across papers                             |
| Gap saturation             | How much of the field has been structurally explored          |
| Temporal evolution         | Concept birth, death, and transformation over time            |
