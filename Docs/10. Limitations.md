# 10. Limitations

While the Discovery Engine represents a significant advance in scientific knowledge infrastructure, it is not without its **limitations, trade-offs, and unresolved challenges**. This section outlines the current boundaries of the system's capabilities, as well as mitigation strategies and areas for future work.

## 10.1 LLM-Related Limitations

| Issue                            | Description                                                                   | Mitigation Strategy                                                   |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hallucination**                | LLMs may generate plausible but unsupported claims during extraction         | All outputs require **justification links** to source text            |
| **Template overfitting**         | LLMs may rigidly conform to templates and miss contextually rich variations  | Use **meta-probes** and schema refinement loops                       |
| **Bias amplification**           | LLMs reflect dominant academic language and norms                            | Weight underrepresented patterns via agent curation and scoring       |
| **Context window limits**        | Long papers may exceed LLM context                                           | Chunking + multi-pass summarisation with internal linking             |

## 10.2 Schema and Representation Challenges

| Issue                            | Description                                                                   | Mitigation Strategy                                                   |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Incomplete Schema Coverage**   | Not all concepts fit neatly into the Universal Concept Schema (UCS)          | Allow schema extension + periodic ontology review                     |
| **Granularity Mismatch**         | Concepts may be too broad or too fine-grained                                | Hierarchical nodes with cross-resolution relations                    |
| **Drift Across Fields**          | Term usage varies by discipline (e.g., "plasticity")                         | Embed vector definitions and ontology links                           |
| **Non-verbal Artifacts**         | Visual data, equations, or simulations hard to capture                       | Future extensions: code parsers, equation encoders, visual captioners |

## 10.3 Knowledge Integrity & Trust

| Issue                            | Description                                                                   | Mitigation Strategy                                                   |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Conflicting Claims**           | Opposed or mutually exclusive statements may co-exist                         | Mark with `CONFLICTS_WITH` edges and confidence scores                |
| **Source Reliability**           | Not all papers have equal credibility or replication                          | Score artifacts by **source tier**, citation depth, and consistency   |
| **Incomplete Provenance Chains** | Some extractions may lack precise justification text                         | Discard low-confidence artifacts or request human confirmation        |
| **Manipulability**               | Users or agents could overload the system with biased inputs                  | Rate-limited write access + audit logging + human moderation tools    |

## 10.4 Computational & Engineering Constraints

| Issue                            | Description                                                                   | Mitigation Strategy                                                   |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalability**                  | Large-scale CNMs consume significant compute for updates and traversal        | Distributed graph storage + batched updates + vector compression      |
| **Latency in Query Composition** | Generative synthesis over large graphs can be slow                            | Use cached tensor views and pre-compiled paths                        |
| **Storage Overhead**             | Artifacts + provenance + embeddings = large storage footprint                 | Compress source snippets, embed selectively, archive old versions     |
| **Agent Complexity**             | Multi-agent workflows can become opaque or unstable                           | Include interpretability layers, log output paths, simulate in sandbox|

## 10.5 User Experience Limitations

| Issue                            | Description                                                                   | Mitigation Strategy                                                   |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cognitive overload**           | Users may find large graphs or tensor outputs hard to interpret               | Provide layered UI views, filtering, and semantic zooming             |
| **Learning curve**               | Users need to understand schema types and agent roles                         | Onboarding tours + domain-specific interfaces                         |
| **Low user trust**               | Outputs may feel too “AI-generated” without human legibility                  | Emphasise traceability and source linking                             |

## 10.6 Conceptual Boundaries

| Limit                            | Description                                                                   | Current Status                                                        |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not a truth oracle**           | DE doesn’t determine truth — only structure and provenance                   | Designed for transparency and plurality, not final answers            |
| **Not fully autonomous**         | Human guidance is still needed for template design, conflict adjudication     | Co-pilot model rather than replacement                                |
| **Not yet complete field coverage**| Many disciplines (e.g., philosophy, art history) remain structurally underrepresented | Building initial corpora, tuning schema for generalisation           |
| **Not closed-world**             | Gaps may reflect limitations in literature, not actual absence                | Gaps are **candidates** for exploration, not final judgments          |

## 10.7 Summary of Known Trade-Offs

| Trade-off Pair                         | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rigidity vs Flexibility**            | Templates enforce structure, but may miss nuance                           |
| **Speed vs Fidelity**                  | Real-time synthesis may simplify semantic richness                         |
| **Automation vs Interpretation**       | Agents produce structure, but users need to verify meaning                 |
| **Coverage vs Noise**                  | Broad extractions may introduce more contradictions                        |
| **Stability vs Evolution**             | Schema convergence conflicts with adapting to new forms of knowledge       |
