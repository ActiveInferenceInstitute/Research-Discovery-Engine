# 2. Motivation

## 2.1 The Scientific Bottleneck

### 2.1.1 The Explosion of Knowledge

Scientific publication volume has grown exponentially across all disciplines. While this signals intellectual vitality, it presents an operational crisis:

- **>2.5 million papers published annually**
- **Thousands of journals and preprint archives**
- **Low signal-to-noise ratio** in many emerging domains

### 2.1.2 Human Cognitive Limits

Even domain experts cannot track developments across their own fields. This leads to:

| Breakdown Point           | Consequence                                                              |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Integration overload**  | Key insights are overlooked or redundantly re-discovered                 |
| **Thematic fragmentation**| Fields diverge without cross-pollination                                 |
| **Review fatigue**        | Increased burden on peer review systems                                  |
| **Bias amplification**    | Citation and prestige loops obscure emerging but valid alternatives      |

> 📉 Science is growing — but our ability to synthesise it isn’t.

## 2.2 Systemic Limitations of Document-Centric Knowledge

Most scientific knowledge is trapped in **linear narrative documents** (PDFs, LaTeX, Word). These formats prioritise readability for humans, but not computability.

| Limitation                              | Impact                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **No modularity**                        | Can't reuse specific methods, values, or assumptions without parsing  |
| **Entangled semantics**                  | Assumptions, claims, and context are embedded in prose                 |
| **Lack of standardised structure**       | Automatic reasoning is hindered                                        |
| **Poor interoperability**                | Difficult to correlate findings across fields                          |
| **Opaque provenance**                    | Data and claims hard to verify or audit                                |

Scientific PDFs are fundamentally **flat**, **opaque**, and **non-composable**.

## 2.3 The Case for Computable Knowledge

What we need is not more content — but **better structure**.

### Reframing the Problem

- Science is not just a corpus of texts; it is a **map of relationships**:  
  between ideas, phenomena, parameters, methods, and results.
- The challenge is to **externalise this map**, structure it, and render it navigable.

### Strategic Pivot

| From…                   | To…                                                |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Discrete publications   | Unified field models                                |
| Free-text claims        | Structured, verifiable knowledge components         |
| Narrative logic         | Graph + tensor semantics                            |
| Manual inference        | AI-supported synthesis and hypothesis generation    |
| Static PDFs             | Living, evolving conceptual networks                |

## 2.4 Why Now? — The Converging Enablers

Several technological and methodological advances now make a transition feasible:

### Enabling Technologies

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Capable of structured extraction when properly guided
- **Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA)**: Enable compact, interpretable knowledge representations
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Provide tools for traversing and analysing conceptual relationships
- **Tensor Representations**: Compress and operationalise multi-dimensional relationships
- **Semantic Embeddings**: Power similarity search and analogy detection

### Alignment with FAIR

The DE’s objectives align with the **FAIR data principles**:

| Principle       | DE Alignment                                                |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Findable**    | Granular metadata, graph nodes                             |
| **Accessible**  | Structured API and visual browser                           |
| **Interoperable**| Unified schema + external ontology mappings               |
| **Reusable**    | Provenance-anchored, composable knowledge artifacts         |

## 2.5 Opportunity for Redesign

The DE is not just a solution to a volume problem — it’s a **strategic re-architecture of the scientific knowledge stack**.

> 🔁 From:  
> “What has been written and cited?”  
> To:  
> “What is known, how is it related, and what remains uncertain?”

## 2.6 Summary: What Drives the Discovery Engine?

### Pain Points

- Information overload
- Semantic fragmentation
- Reproducibility concerns
- Inefficiencies in research design

### Opportunity

- Build a **computable substrate** of science
- Empower **AI agents** to augment cognition
- Reveal the **latent topology** of knowledge
- Accelerate discovery cycles through structured hypothesis generation
