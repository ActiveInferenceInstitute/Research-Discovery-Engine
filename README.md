[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/948595787.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15084931)

## Transforming Scientific Research Through AI-Powered Knowledge Discovery

IntelliDE is an advanced platform that uses artificial intelligence to accelerate scientific discovery, foster interdisciplinary collaboration, and democratize access to knowledge through interactive 3D graph visualization and intelligent agent systems.

## üåü Vision

The Scientific Discovery Engine aims to overcome key limitations in traditional scientific research:
- Metrics-driven evaluation that can restrict innovation
- Publication pressure that fragments research
- Knowledge silos that prevent cross-disciplinary insights
- Information overload that hinders discovery of critical connections

## üß† Core Technology

IntelliDE leverages several cutting-edge technologies:

### CT-GIN Framework
Combines Category Theory and Graph Isomorphism Networks to create structured knowledge representations that identify connections across disciplines.

### Vector-Based Knowledge System
Represents all extracted information as vectors, enabling:
- Concept mapping across research domains
- Sophisticated filtering of relevant information
- Knowledge aggregation from disparate sources

### Active Inference
Uses probabilistic modeling for uncertainty-based hypothesis generation, producing evidence-based research directions rather than random outputs.

### Advanced NLP Processing
- **Automated Literature Analysis**: Processes scientific papers to extract structured knowledge
- **Topic Modeling & Clustering**: Uses BERTopic and SciBERT to discover patterns across research fields
- **Hierarchical Visualization**: Maps research in high-dimensional space for visual exploration

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
Node.js 16+
npm or yarn
Modern web browser with WebGL support
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Research-Discovery-Engine.git
cd Research-Discovery-Engine

# IMPORTANT: Navigate to the application directory
cd DE

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Note**: The application files are located in the `DE/` directory. All npm commands **MUST** be run from within this directory. If you get "package.json not found" errors, ensure you're in the correct directory:

```bash
pwd  # Should show: .../Research-Discovery-Engine/DE
ls package.json  # Should exist
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Recommended: Automated Startup
For the **most reliable startup experience** with proven server detection and comprehensive system validation:

```bash
# From the DE directory
python3 main.py
```

This **proven startup script** will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Check system requirements (Node.js, npm, Python)
- ‚úÖ Verify project structure and dependencies
- ‚úÖ Install dependencies if needed  
- ‚úÖ Start Vite development server with robust detection
- ‚úÖ Open the application in your browser
- ‚úÖ Monitor server health and provide detailed feedback

**üìö For detailed startup documentation**: See [STARTUP_GUIDE.md](DE/STARTUP_GUIDE.md)

### Basic Usage
1. **Explore Mode**: Navigate the 3D knowledge graph using mouse controls
2. **Search**: Use the search bar to find specific concepts or materials
3. **Create Mode**: Design new scientific concepts using the interactive designer
4. **Agent Console**: Interact with AI agents for research assistance
5. **Browser Sidebar**: Browse organized knowledge categories
