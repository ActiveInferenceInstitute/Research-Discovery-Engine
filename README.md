[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/948595787.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15084931)

## Transforming Scientific Research Through AI-Powered Knowledge Discovery

IntelliDE is an advanced platform that uses artificial intelligence to accelerate scientific discovery, foster interdisciplinary collaboration, and democratize access to knowledge through interactive 3D graph visualization and intelligent agent systems.

## üåü Vision

The Scientific Discovery Engine aims to overcome key limitations in traditional scientific research:
- Metrics-driven evaluation that can restrict innovation
- Publication pressure that fragments research
- Knowledge silos that prevent cross-disciplinary insights
- Information overload that hinders discovery of critical connections

## üß† Core Technology

IntelliDE leverages several cutting-edge technologies:

### CT-GIN Framework
Combines Category Theory and Graph Isomorphism Networks to create structured knowledge representations that identify connections across disciplines.

### Vector-Based Knowledge System
Represents all extracted information as vectors, enabling:
- Concept mapping across research domains
- Sophisticated filtering of relevant information
- Knowledge aggregation from disparate sources

### Active Inference
Uses probabilistic modeling for uncertainty-based hypothesis generation, producing evidence-based research directions rather than random outputs.

### Advanced NLP Processing
- **Automated Literature Analysis**: Processes scientific papers to extract structured knowledge
- **Topic Modeling & Clustering**: Uses BERTopic and SciBERT to discover patterns across research fields
- **Hierarchical Visualization**: Maps research in high-dimensional space for visual exploration
