# Research Discovery Engine (IntelliDE)

## Transforming Scientific Research Through AI-Powered Knowledge Discovery

IntelliDE is an advanced platform that uses artificial intelligence to accelerate scientific discovery, foster interdisciplinary collaboration, and democratize access to knowledge.

## üåü Vision

The Scientific Discovery Engine aims to overcome key limitations in traditional scientific research:
- Metrics-driven evaluation that can restrict innovation
- Publication pressure that fragments research
- Knowledge silos that prevent cross-disciplinary insights
- Information overload that hinders discovery of critical connections

## üß† Core Technology

IntelliDE leverages several cutting-edge technologies:

### CT-GIN Framework
Combines Category Theory and Graph Isomorphism Networks to create structured knowledge representations that identify connections across disciplines.

### Vector-Based Knowledge System
Represents all extracted information as vectors, enabling:
- Concept mapping across research domains
- Sophisticated filtering of relevant information
- Knowledge aggregation from disparate sources

### Active Inference
Uses probabilistic modeling for uncertainty-based hypothesis generation, producing evidence-based research directions rather than random outputs.

### Advanced NLP Processing
- **Automated Literature Analysis**: Processes scientific papers to extract structured knowledge
- **Topic Modeling & Clustering**: Uses BERTopic and SciBERT to discover patterns across research fields
- **Hierarchical Visualization**: Maps research in high-dimensional space for visual exploration

## üîß Features

- **Structured Knowledge Extraction**: Parses scientific literature into standardized templates
- **Pattern Detection**: Maps relationships between research fields, topics, and concepts
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Proposes evidence-based research directions
- **Collaboration Facilitation**: Identifies researchers with complementary expertise
- **Visual Knowledge Maps**: Presents complex relationships through intuitive diagrams
- **Interdisciplinary Integration**: Maps knowledge across different scales and domains
- **Continuous Learning**: Refines recommendations based on feedback and new literature

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```
Python 3.8+
Required packages listed in requirements.txt
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intellide.git
cd intellide

# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv env

knowledge_graph = processor.process_document("path/to/paper.pdf")
```

## üìä Project Status

IntelliDE is currently in active development. We are focusing on:

1. Refining the core pipeline:
   - Completing the initial processing script (main.py)
   - Ensuring robust PDF text extraction
   - Validating BERTopic clustering effectiveness

2. Developing the user interface:
   - Creating visualization for knowledge graphs
   - Designing interfaces for hypothesis generation
   - Implementing collaborative features
