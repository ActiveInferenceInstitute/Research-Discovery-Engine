# Create database
createdb resnei_dev

# Run database migrations
cd resnei
python manage.py migrate
cd ..
```

## First Run

### Using Automated Setup (Recommended)

If you used the automated setup, the Discovery Engine should already be running! Look for:

```
üöÄ DISCOVERY ENGINE LAUNCHING
========================================
üåê WEB INTERFACE STARTING...
   üìç Location: /path/to/DE
   üîó URL: http://localhost:5173
   üìä Logs: Real-time output below
========================================
üöÄ Starting Vite development server...
‚è≥ Server initializing... (will auto-open browser)
üîó Manual access: http://localhost:5173
```

Your browser should open automatically to `http://localhost:5173`.

### Manual Startup

If you need to start the Discovery Engine manually:

```bash
cd DE
npm run dev
```

Or use our convenient launcher:
```bash
./start-de.sh
# or
src/scripts/setup/launch-de.sh
```

### Starting Additional Components (Optional)

In separate terminal windows:

```bash
# Web Platform
cd website_explore_the_unknown
npm run dev
# Available at http://localhost:3000

# ResNEI Backend (if database is set up)
cd resnei
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
python manage.py runserver
# Available at http://localhost:8000
